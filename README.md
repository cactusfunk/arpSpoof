# arpSpoof
python script to spoof the arp tables of a victim and a router using scapy    
  
This code is from the book Ethical Hacking: The Hands-on Introduction to breaking in and is part of the exercises in chapter 2. I am including all of my exercises on this github account so that I have a place where I can get advice from other developers and learn as much as possible  

usage is:   

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo python3 arpSpoof.py <VICTIM_IP> <ROUTER_IP>
```
